### Why Kubernetes

Today users expect applications to be available 24/7, while developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times a day. The way we build software is moving in this direction, enabling applications to be released and updated in an easy and fast way without downtime. We also need to be able to scale application in line with the user demand and we expect them to make intelligent use of the available resources. Kubernetes is a platform designed to meet those requirements, using the experience accumulated by Google in this area, combined with best-of-breed ideas from the community.
